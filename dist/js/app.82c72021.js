The greater the mind-muscle connection the more you'll get out of this exercise. It's best to have your knees slightly bent during the set but fixed (ie: bend them slightly but keep them locked in the same place throughout the set). During the descent, to protect your lower back, keep your weight back on the heels. Do not let your weight shift forward onto the toes. If you find the your weight on the toes when at the bottom position of the exercise, you are performing it incorrectly. Do not relax at the bottom of the movement. Keep your legs, back and abdominals tight as you begin the ascent. Keep the rep timing slow and control the weight, especially when lowering. Remember the focus is on stretch and contraction! One of the biggest mistakes people make when performing this exercise is bending over at the waist without moving the hips back. Instead of being supported by the large hamstring muscles, the weight is now placed almost entirely on the lower spine. Needless to say, this puts your back at great risk for injury. If you keep the weight close to your body your hips with naturally move back. Technique is so important with this exercise. If you're just starting out, stand with your side to a mirror with a very light weight and practice the movement. Once you get the technique nailed you'll be able to move up in weight and start building some killer hams and glutes!",video:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_5DEdWpKYj4",Active:!1},{name:"Leg Curl",muscle:["hamstring"],description:"The lying leg curl is a great exercise to isolate the hamstrings. Set up for the leg curl by selecting the weight you want to use on the stack and adjusting the padding to suit your leg length. Lay face down on the machine. The padding should be positioned just above the back of your ankles. If it's higher than that, adjust the length. Tense up the hamstrings by taking the weight slightly off the stack. This is the starting position for the exercise. Squeeze the hamstrings and curl the weight up as far as possible. Squeeze the hamstring hard, and then slowly lower the weight back to the starting position. Repeat for desired reps.",tips:"Common mistakes with the leg curl are; moving the weight up and down too fast and not using a full range of motion. Always control the weight throughout the set. Don't use momentum to move the weight up, and don't allow it to drop back down quickly.

Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor. Reach down and grasp the bar using a shoulder width, double overhand grip. Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”. As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar. Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away. Ensure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips. Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward. Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",tips:"You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot in order to allow the bar to travel linearly. The deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights. In order to prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats in order to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”. The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats. Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length. Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you. Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion. Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar. Scraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend. To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel. Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights. More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement. For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors. The knees should be stacked over the feet. If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies: The knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width. You will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient. If you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes.",video:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GxsLrTzyGUU",Active:!1},{name:"Romanian Deadlift (AKA RDL)",muscle:["hamstring","abs","adductors","calves","forearms","glutes","hamstrings","lats","lower back","quads","traps","upper back"],description:"Position the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a hip width stance.

Begin the RDL by pushing your hips back and hinging forward until the bar is just below knee height. Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away. Return to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",tips:"Range of motion in the lift will largely be determined by an individual’s mobility as well as their ability to maintain a neutral spine. Standing on a box or bench is likely counterproductive as most won’t have the mobility to control that much range of motion effectively. It is typically recommended that you utilize straps or hook grip when going excessively heavy if grip is the limiting factor as you could run into issues with the bar drifting if using mixed grip.

Stand under the bar with your feet at about shoulder width apart. Position the bar so that it is resting on the muscles on the top of your back, not on the back of your neck. The bar should feel comfortable. If it doesn't, try adding some padding to the bar. Now take your hands over the back and grip the bar with a wide grip for stability. You should now bend at the knees and straighten your back in preparation to take the weight off the rack. Keeping your back straight and eyes up, push up through the legs and take the weight off the rack. Take a small step back and stabilize yourself. Keeping your eyes facing forward slowly lower your body down. Don't lean forward as you come down. Your buttocks should come out and drop straight down.

You can ensure your back is straight by keeping your eyes facing forward, chest out, shoulder blades back, and back arched. Keep your core muscles tensed throughout the movement to help hold your back in place. Pushing from the balls of your feet: This puts unnecessary strain on joints and tendons. Always push up through your heels. Curling up your toes can help you get the technique right. Leaning forward: This happens when your hips move up faster than your shoulders. To prevent this keep the rep timing slow and controlled and stick your buttocks out as you go down. Knees come too far forward: When you squat down, your hips should be dropping straight down, not coming forward. Using a light weight, perfect your form standing side on to a mirror. Your knees should never track out and over your toes. Not squatting deep enough: Using squats to their full potential requires squatting down at least until your thighs are around parallel to the floor. Knees in or out: Don't point your knees in or out when you're lowering or pushing the weight. This puts unnecessary strain on the knee joints.

Some forward translation of the knees over the toes is alright provided that the knees don’t deviate excessively inward or outward. Those with longer femurs will have to allow their knees to come farther forward if they want to remain upright. Neck position is highly individual as well - some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking straight ahead.

In other words, the point of rotation for the machine should be in line with your knee joint itself. If the knee is positioned too far in front or behind the axis of rotation, there will be excessive stress added to the joint which could cause significant injury.

Grab a set of dumbbells and stand straight up with the dumbbells at your sides. Your palms should be facing your body. You should be holding the dumbbells slightly off your body, as this keeps the tension on the side delts. This is your starting position for the exercise. To execute, slowly raise the dumbbells up to around shoulder height. It's important that you do not let your wrists go above your elbows while raising the weight, as this will take the work off the side delts and put it on the front delts. Pause at the top of the movement, and then slowly lower the weight back to the starting position. Do not let the dumbbells touch your body, and then raise them for the next rep.",tips:"The dumbbell lateral raise is one of those exercises that so many people do incorrectly. First, this is an isolation exercise, so you should be focusing on stretch and muscle contraction, not using heavy weights. Second, you MUST keep your rep timing slow and controlled. So many people use momentum to swing heavy weights up, and this is not going to get you the best results from the dumbbell lateral raise. Third, it very important that your elbows stay above your wrists. If your wrists come up too far, the focus comes off your side delts and onto your front delts. A good trick to ensure this does not happen is to tilt the dumbbells down as if you were pouring a jug of water as you raise them up. This makes it very hard to raise the wrists higher than the elbows.

Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",tips:"Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured. Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb. If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top. The elbows will be tucked more than a normal bench due to the decrease grip width but if you experience shoulder pain during this variation you may have to slightly tweak grip width and elbow tuck to provide more space within the shoulder capsule. Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury. The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands. As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path. Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first. Fight to the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling. Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses. Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability. Some lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production. Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press. The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum. Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you. Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift. Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back. Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis. Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.

Keep the head in a fairly neutral position, don’t allow the neck to jut forward as this may place excessive pressure on the cervical spine.",video:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YbX7Wd8jQ-Q",Active:!1},{name:"Straight Bar Tricep Extension",muscle:["triceps"],description:"Attach a straight bar to a cable stack as high as possible and assume a standing position. Grasp the straight bar with a pronated grip (palms facing down) and lean forward slightly by hinging at the hips. Initiate the movement by extending the elbows and flexing the triceps. Pull the handle downward until the elbows are almost locked out and then slowly lower under control back to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",tips:"If you want to keep more tension in the triceps, don’t lock the elbows out entirely. Imagine there’s a screw running through your elbow and don’t allow them to move in front of the body as you extend at the bottom of the movement. Experiment with static elbow positioning throughout the lift - some may find that they get a better stretch in the bottom portion of the movement by allowing their elbows to drift behind the body during the eccentric portion of the movement (similar to a drag curl). Ensure the shoulder blades don’t tilt forward as you extend the elbows.",video:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LlBqt8dksdk",Active:!1},{name:"Barbell Upright Row",muscle:["traps","biceps","shoulders"],description:"The barbell upright row is one of the best exercises for building the upper traps and shoulders. Load up a barbell with the weight you want to use and stand facing it with your feet at around shoulder width apart. Grasp the barbell with an overhand grip (palms facing down), and hands slightly closer than shoulder width apart. Pick the bar up, bending at the knees and keeping your back straight. Keeping your back straight and eyes facing forwards, lift the bar straight up while keeping it as close to your body as possible (you should pull the bar up to around chest height - nearly touching your chin). Pause, and then slowly lower the bar back to the starting position. Repeat for desired reps.",tips:"Focus on keeping your elbows higher than your forearms. The elbows push the motion. Keep your body fixed throughout the set. Don't lean forward as you lower the bar, and back as you raise it. Movement of the body makes the upright row easier, and you will not get the most out of it. Pause and squeeze the traps at the top of the movement, and then lower the bar really slowly if you want to add a bit of intensity to the exercise.",video:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/amCU-ziHITM",Active:!1},{name:"Dumbbell Shrug",muscle:["traps","upper back","shoulders","neck"],description:"Assume a standing position with the dumbbells on both sides of your body. Hinge forward, inhale, and grab the dumbbells with a neutral grip. Stand up tall and ensure your spine remains neutral. Contract the traps to elevate the shoulders. Squeeze hard at the top and slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",tips:"Looking slightly up while shrugging may enhance the contraction as traps help to control movement of the skull. This motion should be smooth and controlled, as a ballistic movement could result in a neck injury. The traps tend to respond well to high reps and explosive movements (e.g. snatch grip high pulls) so program your accessory work accordingly. Limit momentum and excessive jerking or bouncing of the weight. No one cares about how much you shrug. Don’t allow the head to jut forward excessively as you squeeze the traps, this can put the neck in a compromised position and result in an injury. Adding a pause at the top of the movement can help to enhance the mind muscle connection.",video:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cJRVVxmytaM",Active:!1},{name:"Barbell Shrug",muscle:["traps","upper back","shoulders","neck"],description:"Position the safeties just below waist height in a rack.
